     *  *actually* be obtained from this Strategy if it were to divest its
     *  entire position based on current on-chain conditions.

     *  systems, which could be manipulated by the attacker to give an inflated
     *  (or reduced) value produced by this function, based on current on-chain
     *  conditions (e.g. this function is possible to influence through
     *  flashloan attacks, oracle manipulations, or other DeFi attack
     *  mechanisms).
     *
     *  It is up to governance to use this function to correctly order this
     *  Strategy relative to its peers in the withdrawal queue to minimize
     *  losses for the Vault based on sudden withdrawals. This value should be
     *  higher than the total debt of the Strategy and higher than its expected
     *  value to be "safe".
     * @return The estimated total assets in this Strategy.
